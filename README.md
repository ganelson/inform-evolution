# inform-evolution

Inform is a mature and widely used programming language, and changes to its
design which are visible to users, or implementation changes on any large
scale, have since 30 July 2022 been proposed and tracked in this repository.
The core repository for the language itself is
[ganelson/inform](https://github.com/ganelson/inform).

## Notes

- Proposals are numbered IE-0001, IE-0002, ... in order of creation. They
will not always be implemented in numerical order.
- The baseline design is Inform version 10.1.0.
- Any change to the Inform design visible to users (and causing a minor or
major version number bump) should be related to a proposal here.
- For now, proposals are made by the Inform team.
- Details are likely to change before release, and proposals listed above as
"waiting to be released" are only mostly final. In particular, comments on
them remain open.

For now, we ask users not to open their own pull requests against this repository,
but users are very welcome to contribute comments in the PR associated with each proposal
for exactly that purpose. For example, [PR#1](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/pull/1) exists for comments on IE-0001.
For more free-flowing discussion about future possibilities, [the Inform area of the intfiction.org forum](https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/inform-7/)
would be the place.
